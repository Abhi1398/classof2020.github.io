<h5>But, My personal suggestion : Do it yourself</h5>
For a developer, github is more powerful than your **CV** or **Resume**, if you have idea how it function and you know the ups and down of github, certainly it will be a highlighter in your Arsenal.

Please give an attempt to do it by yourself,  we will accept any **foolish** mistake. [I](https://www.facebook.com/aakrist36) am making a lot of foolish mistake here, but I am learning, So please at least give a try.

<h4>1. Install git</h4>


If you have attend FIT class of November 2016, then you certainly know what **git** is and probably you have already installed on your device. For our new friends **Sumit**, **Suman**, **Jitendra**, Please download git or you can contact [me](https://www.facebook.com/aakrist36) for git. I strongly recommend our new friends to understand what **git** is and how it functioned.
