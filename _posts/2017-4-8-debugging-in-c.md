# Dare To Debug

C programmers are great inventors of our times. However, there are is no shortage of horror stories about programs that took twenty times to " debug " as they did to "Write". Many a time programs had to be rewritten all over again because the bugs present in them could not be located. Bugs are C programmer's birththright. But how do we chase them away. No sure-shot way for that. I thought if I make a list of more common programming mistakes, it might be a help. They are not arranged in any particular order. But as you realize, surely a great help!
