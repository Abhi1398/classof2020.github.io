To complete your team profile:

1. 	Make a copy of this file and name it firstname_lastname.md. 
	Open that file and edit it. Don't edit this original TEMPLATE file.

2. 	Copy a photo of yourself to the /img/class/ directory. Name 
	it using the firstname_lastname format. Make sure it is a
	square photo, if you look flat that's probably because the picture
	isn't square.
	
3. 	Fill out the above fields: name, photo, place, email, and profile.
	
	- firstname/lastname: Your name as you want it displayed on the 
	team page 
	
	- photo: Filename of the photo you just added to the /img/class/ 
	directory. How about some creativity here?		  
	
	- place: Where you've come from, this is important. We're looking 
	forward to visiting your place soon or later, that's why.
    
	- email: Your email address or leave it blank if you want to be a very 
	secretive person. Never mind ;)
    
	- phonenumber: Your phone number or you can leave it blank. We will 
	verify your number once you make a pull request.
    
	- facebook: Your facebook url(like https://facebook.com/username). 
	Of course this is optional, it's all up to you.
    
	- twitter: Your twitter url(like https://twitter.com/username). This is an
   	optional field.
    
	- linkedin: Link to your LinkedIn profile.((optional))  
    
	- instagram: Link to your Instagram and this is not strict as well.((optionl))
    
	- memberid: In the future if we want to sort the names manually this 
	can be the option. For now, it does not affect anything.	  

4. 	Delete all of this instructional text and replace it with a brief biography. 
	Every other person in the class is curious about 'you'. ;)

5. 	Finally! Save the file, git commit, and git push!
